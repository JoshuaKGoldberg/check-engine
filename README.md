# checker.js

A system version checker in Node.js. Inspired by the [Thali Project][thali] in [validateBuildEnvironment.js][thalicode]

### About

Validates your system to make sure you have the correct system tools and dependencies installed.  Uses the [engine  object][engines] from your `package.json` located in the current directory to determine what system dependencies
or installed tools validate.

### Supported Dependencies

Currently Supporting:
- osx (MacOS)
- node
- npm
- jx (JXCore)
- cordova
- appium
- ios-deploy
- ios-sim
- bower

See the [validatorRules.js file][validator] file for the full list of things that are supported.

### Usage

```npm install -g https://github.com/mohlsen/checker.js.git```

Then run `checker.js` in the root of your project.  It will parse your package.json and validate that you have the versions installed.
